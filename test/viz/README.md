## DAG Execution Visualizations

Below listed are a few visualization of task graphs illustrating the way they were scheduled. In these graphs, the borders are coloured according to the nodes on which they are executed and the fill color indicates the order of execution. The darker the fill color, the earlier it was executed in time.
